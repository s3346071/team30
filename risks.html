<h1>Risks</h1>
<p>
	In looking at key risks to the project we needed to differentiate risks from issues which actually arise in a project and exist today (Expert Program Management).
</p>
<p>
	We also had to make some assumptions such as that our scope is clearly defined. This is critical as once established it will allow us to allocate tasks more efficiently and provide direction (Jamaledine, R 2017). 
</p>
<p>
	We will follow an agile delivery approach such as scrum (Scrum.org) as part of our broader Agile methodology which will help mitigate many common risks, such as:
	<ul>
		<li>Scope creep and “gold plating”
		<li>Inaccurate cost estimates
		<li>Project team misunderstanding requirements
		<li>Poor design 
	</ul>
</p>
