As in all areas of modern life, technology has infiltrated vehicle maintenance. For some time now motor vehicles have had computerized engine control units that can be tapped in to in order to capture performance and diagnostic information (Wojdyla, B 2012). Once owned only by garages, diagnostic tools are now small, affordable and accessible to anyone.

The use of AR in vehicle maintenance appears to be quite a new concept but there are some examples appearing.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2015 Hyandai launched the Hyundai Virtual Guide, a tablet app where “users simply position their phone or tablet’s camera over the part they want to learn about” (Johnson, M 2015). This was originally limited to 2015 and 2016 Sonata models. Since then, Hyundai's efforts in AR appear to focus more on using it for vehicle design and sales quoting.

<p>
BMW are reported to have released Smart Glasses to their dealers and workshops in 2019, allowing technicians in service centres to connect with engineers to work collaboratively through issues (Nica, G 2019). 
</p>
<p>
A US company called Design Interactive (DI) registered the AUGMENTOR trademark in 2020. They advertise virtual equipment training, Classroom AR for training technicians and remote video calling for collaboration (Design Interactive, 2020).
</p>
These are some examples. Many of the concepts touted several years ago don’t appear in more recent searches. However there does appear to be anticipation of a growing opportunity for AR to deliver transport maintenance solutions in the future.
