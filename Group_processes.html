<h1> Group Processes</h1>

<p>As a group Team 30 has continued to work well together. Through the use of MS Teams especially, we have kept our twice weekly
video team meetings going and remained in contact using the messaging or chat functions of MS teams. Once again, we have decided to
assign different sections to different members of the team based on what they feel comfortable working on due to their own personal
previous experience and knowledge, and looking to further this knowledge where possible. Many of the sections to do with the more
technical aspects of the project have been completed by Jake and Leigh. The areas to do with design have been carried out by Emma
and Yury, and the sections dealing with skills, jobs, careers and communications have been completed by Georgia and Andrew.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, the one aspect that needs to be changed is the groups joint use of GitHub and the Team 30 Repository on
GitHub. To correctly show what we as individuals have been working on, we are aiming to all have a larger input to the group’s repository.
This combined once again with MS Teams will allow us to keep track of who is working on what section and if it has been completed or not.
Apart from this, our processes have remained very similar to the previous part of the project.</p>

<h1> Communication</h1>

<p>Team 30 continued with the traditional twice weekly video meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays at six-thirty in the evening (local Melbourne time). Towards the last few weeks
of this project it has been harder to make decisions and communicate effectively as team members have had other appointments and or priorities to attend to, meaning that there
was possibly only one or two meetings where everyone was in attendance.</p>

<p>Apart from the MS Teams video meetings, the chat or messaging function of MS Teams has been regularly used to contact other members of the group to pass on important information.
Text and information for the website has also been regularly updated on a specific document on the MS Teams canvas. The last parts for us to complete individually but also as a
group, will be for us to each transfer our parts that we worked on over to the html documents in git to be added directly onto the group’s website.  After this is done then we
will be able to concentrate on our video presentation.</p>
