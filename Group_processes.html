<h1> Group Processes</h1>

<p>As a group Team 30 has continued to work well together. Through the use of MS Teams especially, we have kept our twice weekly
video team meetings going and remained in contact using the messaging or chat functions of MS teams. Once again, we have decided to
assign different sections to different members of the team based on what they feel comfortable working on due to their own personal
previous experience and knowledge, and looking to further this knowledge where possible. Many of the sections to do with the more
technical aspects of the project have been completed by Jake and Leigh. The areas to do with design have been carried out by Emma
and Yury, and the sections dealing with skills, jobs, careers and communications have been completed by Georgia and Andrew.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, the one aspect that needs to be changed is the groups joint use of GitHub and the Team 30 Repository on
GitHub. To correctly show what we as individuals have been working on, we are aiming to all have a larger input to the groupâ€™s repository.
This combined once again with MS Teams will allow us to keep track of who is working on what section and if it has been completed or not.
Apart from this, our processes have remained very similar to the previous part of the project.</p>
