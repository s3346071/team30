       <td>Leigh</td>
       <td>IT Project Manager</td>
       <td>I had been looking for ages to find online courses that might interest me, I would like to learn some programming, and I am keen to embrace this course and the complexities
       that I will be exposed to. </td>

        <td>Jake</td>
        <td>VR / AR Programmer</td>
        <td>What better way to effect change than with a degree from one of Australia’s top universities – RMIT.  With technology advancing at an exponential rate, having a bachelor of
        IT will be just a start in keeping up with it, but it will also be sure to increase my employability.</td>

<tr>
        <td>Georgia</td>
        <td>Web Developer</td>
        <td>To assist me in building on my knowledge, I have chosen to study at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. My ideal endgame is to accomplish a career in this field.
        With some guidance from my classmates and tutors, I will get a better picture of where I see myself progressing onwards to. Allowing me to initiate a spark of confidence when going
        into the industry. Although I consider that my recent work experience has educated me thoroughly towards working within teams, communication skills, and customer facing service,
        I am seeking to learn the approach that should be taken in this industry professionally. Throughout this course, I expect to acquire skills that demonstrate how to communicate with
        clients and colleagues in a sophisticated tone, collaborate with others, and reach out to clients in the IT world.</td>

<tr>
    <td>Emma</td>
    <td>Mid-to-Senior Unity Developer</td>
    <td>In my own time I have also learnt 3D modeling in Blender and how to make a small game in Unity. I wanted to become a games developer at the time but now I’m not sure, there are so
    many areas of IT for me to try out first. I decided to jump back into studying after I saw my dad complete a course online for logistics through open universities at RMIT. He had a
    good experience and I knew RMIT was a reputable university, plus online learning would be a better fit for me than enrolling at the local university. During my studies I expect to
    learn about a wide variety of IT subjects and how to effectively understand, apply, and communicate IT solutions. I expect to learn how to work both in teams and independently so as
    to become an employable worker in the IT industry.</td>

<tr>
    <td>Andrew</td>
    <td>IT Project Manager</td>
    <td>I am definitely eager to learn more about web design and IT networking through these studies. However, my aim is simply to learn as much as possible. I hope to be able to learn
    more about new tools available to enhance my creativity side. Hopefully this course will open my eyes to the endless amount of possibilities that the future will provide for us through
    IT advancements.</td>

<p>From the above career plans taken from our original personal profiles (assignment 1), it is clear that all team members are relying on this course to provide them with a strong foundation
to be able to gain employment in their chosen areas, or at least to be able to provide them with a solid base to continue learning from and gain further experience either from another course,
or by actually working in the industry and gaining experience directly through employment. Self-learning through personal exploration into important skills and technology also seems to be a
key factor in being able to gain more knowledge which will have a positive influence on gaining employment in the IT industry. </p>

<p>With this being noted, Team 30 has once again gone about this phase of the project by self-designation. During our team meeting on 03rd November 2020, as a team we went through the
different sections of the assignment and designated the sections to team members that felt they had the skills and or knowledge to be able to complete the section with the assistance of
further investigation. For assignment two which was the first phase of our group work, we agreed that we would input our text onto a document on MS Teams, and from there, Yury would copy
the text over and place it on the website. As Yury’s ideal job is to become a Full Stack Web Developer, this was one of the ideal jobs that actually intertwined with a distinct role in this
project group, as he has taken on the responsibility of the design of the website. Jake as the brainchild of this project, has always had a very hands on approach. As he will one day be a
VR / AR programmer himself, he is showing his ability to get the job done, and the ‘know-how’ of how VR / AR actually works by completing the sections that have required a bit more technical
knowledge. </p>

<p>Emma will put her design abilities and desire to become a Mid-to-senior Unity Developer to good use by producing an artifact of what our program will most likely look like. Unfortunately,
Georgia was not able to join the meeting where the sections were spread amongst the team members. Therefore, she was assigned the remaining sections, and also based on the fact that she
she completed the ideal jobs for the previous phase or part of this group work. However, she will have the chance to show us what she is capable of achieving as a future web developer when she
inserts her parts of the assignment to the group’s website. </p>

<p>Leigh and Andrew, as future IT Project managers, have been a part of just about every group meeting (Leigh has attended all group meetings, and Andrew has missed one throughout the entire
process). Both of these team members have been active in group discussions and trying to always help the groups processes along whenever possible by adding thoughts, ideas, and personal
opinions. The ideas mentioned above are just some basic examples of how our designated tasks tie in best to our ideal jobs of the future. </p>

 <tr>
     <td>Yury</td>
     <td>Full Stack Web Developer</td>
     <td>This job is still appealing to me as my formal education path and my self-education journey in web development closely align with the requirements needed to be successful in this position.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
      <td>Leigh</td>
      <td>IT Project Manager</td>
      <td>Because of my strengths in the baseline skills as against more IT specialised skills (at this stage at least) I feel most suited to this role in the industry. Communicating and interacting with others, and having more general control of the end-to end of a project really appeals to me.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
        <td>Jake</td>
        <td>VR / AR Programmer</td>
        <td>There are many industries that can benefit from AR/VR. I believe this to be a high growth area in the IT sphere. As such, I continue feel excited about working as a VR/AR Programmer. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
        <td>Georgia</td>
        <td>Web Developer</td>
        <td>I would like to continue going ahead with working towards this career. Web development and design has always been something that has caught my interest, and I would hope to tie it into creating websites for artists in the music industry as a freelance worker.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Emma</td>
    <td>Mid-to-Senior Unity Developer</td>
    <td>This job is still appealing to me as game development is a passion of mine, however I may consider self-employment in the future which will allow me more freedom with projects.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Andrew</td>
    <td>IT Project Manager</td>
    <td>I still believe that this is the right job for me as this job really combines a need for highly sort after IT skills, plus it also requires many personal skills like communication, problem-solving, organizational skills. These are not only the top three generic skills required according to Burning glass, but they are also some key strengths of mine personally.</td>

<p>After completing the last phase of this project (Assignment 2), and reviewing the required skill set and taking job ranking into consideration, all team members are remaining with their
chosen ideal job. All team members alluded to the fact that their chosen ideal job has a factor that means something personal to them. Whether it be related to a hobby that they are
passionate about, or tied together with a personal characteristic which is considered a strength for the position, all ideal jobs contain an element where there is a genuine interest in
working in the chosen role which acts as a motivation to keep working towards achieving this role someday.</p>

<p>Looking further at the ideal jobs, we can pair up these roles from the members of the group. The ideal jobs from Yury and Georgia are definitely more centered around web development
and design, a Full Stack Web Developer, and a Front-end developer. These roles not only require creativity but also a clear understanding of how websites are made and more importantly,
what is required to make a clear and successful website. Jake and Emma’s ideal jobs are more to do with graphics. Jake’s ideal job is as a VR / AR Programmer and Emma’s ideal job is as a
mid to senior Unity Developer. Both of these positions may require creativity skills, but also skills in knowing how best to use graphics and presenting information as required when
working through a program. Andrew and Leigh have the same ideal job, that is working as a IT Project Manager. This job requires experience in working in a team that is often responsible
for the implementation of a new system or technology in the work place or intended company.  Often a deep understanding of one particular technology is not needed, however a broad
understanding of many different technologies and systems that are available are important to have in this role.</p>

<p>The common factor from all ideal jobs from the group, is that team work is required. Therefore, the top three baseline skills according to the Burning Glass data are vital in all of
these roles. That being, able to not only communicate (rank one) but also listen to what is being communicated to the team,  Problem solving (rank 2), and organizational skills (rank 3).
By combining these skills and more, will definitely set all team members on the right track to working well together and being successful at the given task.</p>
