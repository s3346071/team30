<h1>Groups processes and communications</h1>

<p>Team 30 continued with the traditional twice weekly video meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays at six-thirty in the evening (local Melbourne time). Towards the last few weeks
of this project it has been harder to make decisions and communicate effectively as team members have had other appointments and or priorities to attend to, meaning that there
was possibly only one or two meetings where everyone was in attendance.</p>

<p>Apart from the MS Teams video meetings, the chat or messaging function of MS Teams has been regularly used to contact other members of the group to pass on important information.
Text and information for the website has also been regularly updated on a specific document on the MS Teams canvas. The last parts for us to complete individually but also as a
group, will be for us to each transfer our parts that we worked on over to the html documents in git to be added directly onto the groupâ€™s website.  After this is done then we
will be able to concentrate on our video presentation.</p>
