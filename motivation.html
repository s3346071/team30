<h1>Motivation</h1>

<p>
Team 30 chose this project for several reasons. Augmented Reality is something that few of us understood, but through our research for assignment 2 and our coursework, we have become excited by its potential. Once only the domain of science fiction, AR is suddenly becoming a real thing and it is claimed that the AR industry could be worth $25 billion by 2025 (Islam, A 2018). So, this is an opportunity to immerse ourselves in one of the cutting edges of IT.  
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, as a useful tool we believe that the RGM has value. The completion of accurate pre-start checks and improving the speed of truck repairs are genuine problems for the transport industry. When mature, the RGM has scope for use in all kinds of machinery maintenance. 
</p>
<p>
Team 30 believe that embracing this challenge to deliver a solution of practical value using a cutting-edge technology would demonstrate innovative thinking and a can-do attitude. These were key personal attributes that came out in our interview with an IT industry professional in assignment 2 as attractive to employers.
