<h1>Project Component</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Topic</h3>
<p>In continuing to develop the RGM product, Team 30 wishes to outline a few of our goals and a rough timeline to which we would like to progress along. We will go into more depth on the timeline a little later but for now we will give a broad overview. Nine weeks have elapsed since the inception of the RGM idea. Six weeks since it has become our top priority. We have only developed the idea on paper and within our minds, to date, we have not developed any proof of concepts or hard artifacts. We believe that the next step in developing this project is to establish several hard artifacts which aim to give a visual example of our product. We believe in the age old adage that a picture speaks a thousand words and as such, we would like to consider our options regarding a few visual representations.   
</p>
<p>Regarding our timeline, we understand that our project will take time to develop, how much time depends on a number of factors. Initially the largest thing holding us up is our time constraints. As the project in itself does not generate income, we must all continue in our full time employment, not able to commit more than a few hours a day and sometimes less. High upfront costs for the technology that we need is also limiting our capacity for development. As much as this next pitfall is not so much of a limiting factor, but more of a small hurdle, it does seem daunting non-the-less – and that is that each member of Team 30 is new to the world of technological innovation, development and implementation. However, all members are optimistic about and committed to the proliferation of technology and particularly augmented reality. We keep this challenges in mind but do not let them get in the way of planning. Following our next three weeks of planning, we hope to present our findings and artifacts to several companies. If we are fortunate enough to gain financial support then full time development would ensue.
</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Team 30 chose this project for several reasons. Augmented Reality is something that few of us understood, but through our research for assignment 2 and our coursework, we have become excited by its potential. Once only the domain of science fiction, AR is suddenly becoming a real thing and it is claimed that the AR industry could be worth $25 billion by 2025 (Islam, A 2018). So, this is an opportunity to immerse ourselves in one of the cutting edges of IT.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, as a useful tool we believe that the RGM has value. The completion of accurate pre-start checks and improving the speed of truck repairs are genuine problems for the transport industry. When mature, the RGM has scope for use in all kinds of machinery maintenance. Team 30 believe that embracing this challenge to deliver a solution of practical value using a cutting-edge technology would demonstrate innovative thinking and a can-do attitude. These were key personal attributes that came out in our interview with an IT industry professional in assignment 2 as attractive to employers.
</p>

<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>As in all areas of modern life, technology has infiltrated vehicle maintenance. For some time now motor vehicles have had computerized engine control units that can be tapped in to in order to capture performance and diagnostic information (Wojdyla, B 2012). Once owned only by garages, diagnostic tools are now small, affordable and accessible to anyone.
</p>
<p>The use of AR in vehicle maintenance appears to be quite a new concept but there are some examples appearing.
</p>
<p>Back in 2015 Hyandai launched the Hyundai Virtual Guide, a tablet app where “users simply position their phone or tablet’s camera over the part they want to learn about” (Johnson, M 2015). This was originally limited to 2015 and 2016 Sonata models. Since then, Hyundai's efforts in AR appear to focus more on using it for vehicle design and sales quoting.
</p>
<p>BMW are reported to have released Smart Glasses to their dealers and workshops in 2019, allowing technicians in service centres to connect with engineers to work collaboratively through issues (Nica, G 2019). 
</p>
<p>A US company called Design Interactive (DI) registered the AUGMENTOR trademark in 2020. They advertise virtual equipment training, Classroom AR for training technicians and remote video calling for collaboration (Design Interactive, 2020).
</p>
<p>These are some examples. Many of the concepts touted several years ago don’t appear in more recent searches. However there does appear to be anticipation of a growing opportunity for AR to deliver transport maintenance solutions in the future.

<h2>Scope and Limits</h2>

<p>We are excited about the technology sector and with endless ideas about add-ons, enhancements and features, defining the scope and limits for our project has proven to be a difficult task. We understand that time is limited and thus, not to undertake any tasks that are not going to be feasible within the 13 week deadline. So then, through numerous team discussions and discussion with industry professionals, we have whittled down our ideas to three key deliverables that we would like to achieve by the end of this current phase. We aim to deliver a presentation of the Graphical User Interfaces for each screen of the application. We aim to create an example of augmented reality using Roar (online). We also aim to create a demonstration of a troubleshooting guide that will be embedded on this website. These deliverables we believe to be manageable in the timeframe that we are working with. However, we will remain flexible and have decided upon three deliverables to give ourselves a redundancy. We will be accepting if one to two out of three of these deliverables are not successfully completed.  
</p>
<p>Our workload consists of more than the development of these deliverables. We also intend on developing our proposal by reporting on key information such as what skills would be ideal in a team if an investor were to fund the project. We also intend on forecasting a timeframe to have certain aspects of the project started and finished. As well as describing some risks that we face and market competitors that we would be competing with.  
</p>
<p>We do not intend on going into depth regarding the budget for our project, nor do we intend on delving into the legal implications of anything discussed. There are organisations out there with a much greater appreciation of these aspects than us.  
</p>
<P>It is also important that we make the reader aware of what our technology is not designed to do and what we will not be discussing here. It is not designed to remove the need for mechanics. Do not be fooled, your company is not ready to lose its mechanics and outsource the role of the remote mechanic to an external service provider. RGM is intended to reduce the burden on your mechanics by empowering your drivers to do more by themselves. The fact is however, that many jobs still require the technical skills of a qualified technician. RGM should be thought of a supplement to existing processes that your company already operate on. Furthermore, our technology does not aim to target the general public. Investors wanting us to develop this product for the general public are warned that the upfront cost will be substantial and will not be likely to pay off in the medium to long term. 
</P>

<h2>Aims</h2>

<p>Let the reader not focus on this first point, but it is important that we make them aware of it and that we (Team 30) use it to guide our work; Possibly our single most important aim is to find partnership and financial support with a potential future customer. We need to partner closely with a potential customer in order that we develop a product that suits their specific needs, particularly their fleet of vehicle, their standard operating procedures and their financial constraints. With the backing of a company that trusts us, we believe that tangible progress can be made in a timely manner.  
</p>
<p>In achieving this aim, we intend to strive for the following goals: 
</p>
<p>Goal #1 – Define our scope and limits. To keep us on track we need to define the outcomes that we hope to achieve. We are aware of ‘scope creep’ and wish to avoid this as best we can so that we can focus on achieving outcomes that are realistic. By defining the scope of our project, we will have a statement that we can come back to when we find ourselves at dead ends. We can return to the scope, re evaluate previous decisions, make adjustments and re initiate the fight.  
</p>
<p>We also wish to be very definitive about the limits of our project. This is not the limitations of resources but more about what our product is not being designed to do. Such things include the use of RGM to replace mobile mechanics. Our system is intended to supplement mobile mechanics, not to replace them. We also do not wish to develop a product for use by everyday consumers. This would be a huge burden on time and resources simply based on that fact that there are thousands of models of cars out there and creating AR overlays for each of them would not be feasible.  
</p>
<p>Goal #2 – Identify the skills and jobs needed to bring RGM into fruition. We know that our learning and understanding capacity has a limit. We believe that sometimes it is more time and cost effective to hire a professional to help with certain tasks. The idea of this goal is to determine exactly what skills are necessary for the execution of our project. Our intention is to create a conceptual team of four members and detail the skills and roles of those individuals. If the project were to receive funding from a venture capitalist or company, we need to know exactly what people with what skill sets are going to be needed. We intend to keep the team small in the start-up phase to encourage cross pollination between team members. Keeping the team small initially will also keep the cost of labour to a minimum for investors.  
</p>
<p>Goal #3 – Develop some artifacts. As touched on in the overview, we believe that the development of visual artifacts to be important. Not only will it increase the understanding of our idea for potential customers but it gives us encouragement and makes us excited about the project all the more. Artifacts are simply the next progression in our project development. An artifact that we will be focussing on is the creation of the graphical user interface for each of the screens within the RGM application on the HoloLens. This will be developed by our UI Designer on Photoshop and presented on a PowerPoint presentation. We also intend on creating a few AR examples on <a href="https://theroar.io/">ROAR</a>. Another artifact we intend to develop is in relation to the fault diagnosis aspect of the application. We will put together step by step troubleshooting guides for five separate faults and imbed them into our website.
</p>
<p>Goal #4 – Develop a plan for testing our concept. Testing is an absolute necessity in the process of any development project. Testing will be ongoing following the implementation of any updates or developments to the project. However, we think that it is important to begin testing right now. As such, we will develop two tests that can begin at any time but preferably sooner rather than later. First, we want to proof the concept of conducting technician to driver instructed repairs using a live video stream. For this we intend to describe how we would stage a test of this function using technology that we all have access such as a facetime call. We intend to list what equipment is needed, how it will be recorded and how it will be documented and presented. A second test is one designed to gauge the appetite for our product from companies in the transport industry. The test will consist of a description describing how we aim to reach out to companies, and ask them targeted questions about what aspects of maintenance are important and costly to them.

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
 
<h3>Software</h3>

<p>Part of the remote guided lens’s function is assisting the driver with the maintenance of the vehicle. Therefore, the HoloLens needs to recognize different parts of the vehicle such as: battery, alternator, oil cap, radiator etc. Technology assisting with this task will be Python, OpenCV and Deep Learning. 
</p>
<p>Software platform for AR development will be Unity AR. Students enrolled in an accredited educational institution are free to use the Unity AR package.
</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>

<p>The main hardware is the Microsoft HoloLens 2 which is available in Australia here, and retails for AU$5,599.00 incl. GST. As of May 2020, the HoloLens 2 does not have integrated 4G or 5G. While the technology catches up to the ideal requirements of RGM we can use an alternative means of network connectivity. A USB modem such as the Telstra 4GX gives users access to 4G data on the go. The 4GX coupled with this USB-C to USB 3.0 adapter can be plugged into the USB-C port of the HoloLens. Alternatively, given the cost of the Hololens, we would like to source a lower cost headset with similar functionality. 
</p>



<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>
	Ultimately our success will be determined by whether the market sees merit in the RGM, so a key test step will be engaging with potential customers and 
	providing a prototype or <b>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</b>.  This will enable us to observe their actual behavior with the RGM. Seeing what a customer might 
	do with the MVP is likely to be more reliable than just asking – though we would ask also to get as much of an understanding of our market as possible. 
	In Agile project methodology an MVP is a version of a new product that allows a team to “collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers 
	with the least effort” (Agile Alliance, 2020). 
</p>
<h3>An example MVP demonstration scenario:</h3>
	<p>
		Resources required: 
		<ul>
			<li>A hat/helmet with front facing phone holder 
			<li>A video enabled smart phone with Skype 
			<li>A computer or another smart phone with Skype 
			<li>A vehicle or training aid with an induced fault 
			<li>Tools 
			<li>Vehicle repair manual 
		</ul>
	</p>
  
<h3>Method:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>With a truck have a third party technician block the breather of a trucks fuel tank (so that neither the driver nor technician know what the fault is) 
		<li>Give the truck to a driver and ask him to drive it until it stops and then pull over to the side of the road (due to the breather being blocked, fuel will eventually stop being sucked into the fuel line leading to the engine). 
		<li>Direct the driver to establish a Skype call between with a technician in a separate location. 
		<li>Direct the technician to identify the fault by asking the driver to show what has happened. 
	</ol>
	
<p>	
The outcome following step 4 is variable. Should the technician be able to identify the fault, they should then give direction for fixing the fault. If the 
technician is unable to identify the fault, they will at least know what the fault is not. 
</p>
<p>
This means the driver will know what parts they do not need to pack 
and they will have additional time on the road to continue to think about the cause of the fault. 
</p>

<p>
	Initially we would look to approach 12-15 transport companies with the aim of getting a representative feel of feedback. Key players would be:
	<ul>
		<li>Finance personnel who make decisions but should also understand the financial impact of vehicle downtime.
		<li>Fleet managers and maintenance staff who would ultimately be the back-end users. It would be important for our team involved in dialogue to frame the solution as an aid to the maintenance team rather than any threat to their role.
		<li>Drivers who are also end users and are critical to get on-board and embrace the technology. Negative attitudes from drivers can spread like cancer and could de-rail engagement.
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
Assuming that we do succeed in getting potential customers excited, further testing will be required as early as possible and continue through the software development life cycle.
</p>

<p>
There are many different testing techniques that can be deployed. Team 30 would look to perform a combination “white box testing” where there is close examination of the software code and “black box testing” where functional components of the application are tested to ensure that it behaves as expected. It does also include non-functional testing such as performance, load and security (Rajkumar, 2020).
</p>

<p>
Our testing regime would address the following testing levels in this order:
	<ul>
		<li>Unit Testing – or component testing where individual components of the software are tested to ensure they are working properly.
		<li>Integration testing – to test the connectivity and data transfer between the components of the RGM.
		<li>System Testing (or end-to end testing) – this is black box testing where our test plan would include a matrix of scenario’s to see that the full system works as expected.
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
Then once we are ready to release our product:
	<ul>
		<li>Acceptance Testing – obtain customer sign off.  
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Risks</h2>

<p>
	In looking at key risks to the project we needed to differentiate risks from issues which actually arise in a project and exist today (Expert Program Management).
</p>
<p>
	We also had to make some assumptions such as that our scope is clearly defined. This is critical as once established it will allow us to allocate tasks more efficiently and provide direction (Jamaledine, R 2017). 
</p>
<p>
	We will follow an agile delivery approach such as scrum (Scrum.org) as part of our broader Agile methodology which will help mitigate many common risks, such as:
	<ul>
		<li>Scope creep and “gold plating”
		<li>Inaccurate cost estimates
		<li>Project team misunderstanding requirements
		<li>Poor design 
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Plans and Progress </h2>

<h3>The origin</h3>

<p>The concept that is RGM was the brainchild of Team 30 member Jake Q. Jake works in the automotive industry where he is tasked to undertake repairs in a static workshop as well as in the field environment. The operation of most static workshops is quite smooth and has not changed a great deal over time. Small changes include developments in the physical equipment and tooling being used to make working on and under cars more ergonomic and faster. A good example of this is the vehicle hoist replacing dug out pits in many workshops. However, when we take a look at field service, there are many more elements to take into consideration here, where if any aspect is neglected, large financial costs can be occur and safety be at risk. To mention a few:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Time taken for the technician to arrive at a breakdown site </li>
    <li>Ambiguity of the actual cause of the breakdown leading to;   </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Wrong parts being taken to the breakdown site </li>
        <li>Wrong tools being taken to the job </li>
        <li>Wrong technician being tasked for the repair </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Broken down vehicles causing obstruction on main roads  </li>
</ol>

<p>Jake has been on field service duty in the past where he once had to drive four hours to a breakdown in remote Australia. The information which he was using to prepare resources for the move came from the experienced but unqualified observations of the truck driver. The fault described by the driver turned out to be a symptom of the root cause. As such, Jake was not prepared for the job appropriately leading to an unsuccessful field service job.  
</p>
<p>It was shortly after this and subsequent occurrences of similar events that the idea came about of guiding an operator who is in a remote environment to conduct simple repairs themselves. There was also a realisation that the operator does not always need to get in touch with a technician because there is often fault diagnosis guides in the user handbook of these vehicles. The problem is, the user handbook will reference certain vehicle parts and expect that the driver will know where to find those parts. Sometimes these diagnosis/repair guides use jargon unfamiliar to day to day operators. A more suitable system would need to show operators where to find the components being referenced in the user handbook. Sometimes too, the user handbook can be difficult to navigate, flicking back and forth between pages.  
</p>
<p>At this point Jake had not had a great deal of experience with technology and was not aware of many emergent technologies. He began studying a bachelor of IT where he began learning about different aspects of IT and had access to professionals in the sector. Jake’s first assignment required him to think about an innovative IT idea and begin to flesh it out. He decided to take on the idea of maintenance in the field and coined the name Remote Guided Maintenance (RGM). In a conversation with his lecturer – Dave – about the idea, Dave advised Jake to have a look into the Microsoft HoloLens II as a platform to develop the idea on.  
</p>
<p>The functionality that an AR device such as the HoloLens offers provided answers to how most of the intended functions of RGM could work. Due to there being a front facing camera on the device and the fact the device is wearable meant that the operator could have both of his hands free to conduct any instructions given him by the technician. The augmentation that the HoloLens facilitates also meant that drivers could physically be guided to the location of components when reading through troubleshooting guides.  
</p>
<p>The idea continued to develop further than just video link between technician and operator and the augmentation of component parts for troubleshooting. It was decided that extra features should be added in order to encourage preventative maintenance and to demonstrate certain vehicle functions. Preventative maintenance is about conducting regular inspections of key components in order to pick up anything out of order before it becomes a major issue. A screen was thus conceptualised where the driver would wear the HoloLens whilst conducting these inspections and AI technology would pick up if anything was amiss about the vehicle and components which the driver may ordinarily miss.  
</p>
<p>For the next assignment (A2), Jake partnered with five other members in the course where they developed RGM further as a group project. They used A2 to identify all the functions that they thought were feasible for RGM which consisted of the following five screens: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>First and Last Parade  </li>
    <li>Vehicle Specifications </li>
    <li>Component Identifier and Descriptor  </li>
    <li>Troubleshooting and Diagnosis</li>
    <li>Contact the Mechanic   </li>
</ul>

<p>In A2, they also covered some ideas about how the product would be marketed, the technology required and how it would connect all the key components being the HoloLens, the truck, Cloud servers and the Transport Operations Manager.  
</p>
<p>Following the submission of A2 we have begun to develop this project idea into more of a proposal. We are now looking at defining the scope of the project, as well as its limitations and associated risks. We are setting goals to keep us focused on the important things. Another big push for us is to develop some artifacts and proofs of concept that we can use to help potential investors gain a better understanding of what our product will look and feel like. 
</p>

<h3>Handover</h3>

<p>We understand that our team cannot achieve the entirety of this project on our own. Although it would be possible to achieve, we do not currently have the time, money or skills to carry it out in a sustainable way. By the end of week 13, the ground work will have been laid for the project. A timeline has been established, key skills and jobs have been identified, risks have been identified, prototype GUI’s for the Hololens have been developed and much more.  Below we discuss the key aspects of our project that must be considered by anyone wishing to take on this project. 
</p>

<h4>Timeline</h4>
<p>The timeline makes clear and provides a good reference for where the team has been making progress. It also provides direction by detailing what the areas of concentration will be into the foreseeable future. Progress from weeks one to six of the project are not included in the timeline. Weeks one to six were largely about establishing Team 30, getting to know the RGM concept and a small amount of development on top of the original concept. Using the timeline for reference, from weeks seven up until week 12, individual and collective lines of effort (LOE’s) have been distributed among members of Team 30. These LOE’s have included but were not limited to: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Establishing a group reflection continuum so that we can identify issues in a timely manner and build on our strengths. </li>
    <li>Detailing our motivation to pursue RGM. </li>
    <li>Describing the tools and technologies required to make this concept a reality.  </li>
    <li>Identifying the landscape (competitors). </li>
    <li>Making clear our scope and limits for the project so that we do not waste time on superfluous tasks. </li>
    <li>Setting goals to provide direction. </li>
    <li>Identifying and attempting to mitigate risks; and </li>
    <li>Describing the skills and jobs required for the development of RGM. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Scope and Limits</h4>

<p>We identified in our scope and limits the things that we wanted to achieve by the 13 week mark. We also listed several things that our project would not include.  
</p>
<p>In summary, we aimed to achieve up to three deliverables. One being a UI design of each of the major screens for the application. The second being a ROAR AR graphic. The third being a troubleshooting guide embedded into a website. Although we were unable to finalise the latter two deliverables, we assess that this will not hinder the follow on teams ability to move forward with development of the product.  
</p>
<p>The limits we set for ourselves in the weeks up to and including week 13 were as follows: Do not detail the budget in depth, do not delve into legal implications, and finally, not to alter the concept in our proposal by stating that it would replace mechanics or suit the everyday motorist. In stating these limits, does not prevent the follow on project development team pursuing such tasks. Furthermore, it is likely that in the not  too distant future, costings and budget will need heavy consideration as well as any legal implications considered. 
</p>

<h4>Other</h4>

<p>To further progress the RGM idea, we assessed that a team be made using the following make up - Project Manager, Full Stack Developer, AR/Unity Developer and a Qualified Heavy Automotive Mechanic. See the section titles ‘Skills and Jobs’ for a detailed break down of these positions.  
</p>
<p>It is important to consider the risks associated with RGM before committing to take on the project. Limitations to cellular reception across regional parts of Australia could dimmish the appeal of the product. It is possible that potential customers will not see value in the product. This could be due to confusion over what the product can do or possibly due to stronger competition already available on the market.  For more information on this, see the ‘Risks’ and ‘Landscape’ section.   
</p>
<p>Testing the RGM concept must begin as soon as possible. As a <b>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</b> we developed a scenario using, a driver, vehicle, technician and camera. This MVP can be used to assess how often and for what exact purpose a company might use the product for. See the section called ‘Testing’ for the method and further description regarding this area.   
</p>
<p>Consider what software is required to program in AR. As students, we at Team 30 can use many software platforms for free. Consider the fact you may be required to pay for commercial licenses. To bring down the initial costs of prototyping RGM, rather than using the MS HoloLens, it is strongly recommended that an alternative AR headset be sourced. The ‘Tools and Technologies’ section provides further details on software and hardware considerations. 
</p>
<p>If you or your enterprise do wish to take the RGM idea forward, we would be more than pleasured to provide an extensive handover. We remain available to answer any of your questions and look forward to working alongside anyone who shares our vision.  
</p>
<p>Thankyou.</p>
