    <h2>Reflections</h2>

    <h3>Yury</h3>
    <p>As a team we worked exceptionally well. Regular team meetings helped us stay on track and understand everyone's strengths, knowledge and interests better, that we then leveraged when assigning tasks.  Everyone showed great knowledge of collaborative online tools such as MS Teams and GitHub. This time around all of the team members showed good knowledge of GitHub and used the team’s repository to upload their tasks as an HTML file. This approach worked very well.  Working in a group environment helped me better understand what makes for a successful group project such as clear and regular communication, organisation of tasks, leveraging of expertise and skill, positive attitude, pro-active management of tasks to be done which were all displayed by Team 30. </p>

    <p>Assignment 3 has been a little more challenging in terms of time. I think that most of us struggled with other genuine commitments that clashed with the meeting times established for assignment 2. The group dynamic has always been positive, but I think that we lost some momentum as attendance fluctuated.  </p>
    <p>The group did agree to put our assignment 2 reflection into action and got more involved with the github activity.

I have learned that when others are not around you need to step up. When the group was larger and well attended I felt more conscious about imposing myself. When there were fewer of us meeting and we needed action, I was more comfortable jumping in. I guess this is natural and group size does have an impact on dynamic. Ideally I’d like to be less reserved regardless of the group size. </p>
    <p>On reflection, perhaps it does help to assign a leadership role to someone or formally assign roles to give individuals ownership of a particular jurisdiction. We are all quite easygoing personalities, and probably cruised along for a while, though I think that we came together as the deadline loomed. </p>
    <p>Discussing alternative meeting times or exploring other ways to work collaboratively to suit  everyone’s schedule might help. For example pairing up members who have similar availability so that they can still work together then report back to the broader team might be an option. These kinds of open discussions were probably unlikely to happen in our first unit, however it has been a good learning experience and I know that I will be better equipped for future group work. </p>

    <p>Overall Team 30 worked extremely well to get this assignment in considering the circumstances. Assignment three proved substantially more challenging than A2. There were more aspects to this assignment and the tasks were somewhat ambiguous. One particularly challenging part was the fact that some tasks in this assignment could not be completed without other parts first being completed. I had a work commit that prevented the timely submission of much of my content. Certain members of the team took great initiative in filling in the gaps which certainly pulled the team through.  </p>
    <p>Assignment three has reminded me that clearly defined tasks and strong leadership can make or break group assignments. However, at the end of the day, the course work needs to be completed and no amount of coordination will guarantee this. Assignment three has also taught me not to take group work too seriously and to refrain from perfectionism. Looking back, it is the journey that is the important part, not only learning new things about IT but meeting other like-minded people and learning how to work with them via remote means. I did enjoy getting to know the team members through the short conversations we had at the beginning and end of our formal meetings.   </p>

    <h3>Andrew</h3>
    <p>I feel that I have been very fortunate to be a part of Team 30. Over the past nine weeks or so of working in the group, I have learnt not only more about team work and different technologies, however also more about myself. I was happy to finally use some more functions of GitHub and see how exactly the control source system is used in real life. I am sure that with time and more exposure to GitHub I will become more confident using it and be able to use it for more projects in the future. Even though towards the end of the group project, things did not go the way we had planned or hoped for, we really had to pull together as a group in the end and do all we could to complete what needed to be done. Designating specific roles within the group may have helped our processes, however, as we managed to assign all the different required sections with ease, I believe this was still an efficient way of obtaining our goal and being successful as a team. </p>

    <h3>Emma</h3>
    <p>I have found that everyone in our team has contributed their fair share and we have all worked together well. Having regular meetings scheduled worked well as most of the group was able to attend each one. Dividing the assignment into sections also worked well as everyone was able to choose an area to work on that interested them. I believe the only improvement we could make is for each of us to make commits on GitHub in order to show our contributions. A personal improvement I need to make is to check teams more regularly and communicate my progress more often. What surprised me most about our team is how we fell into certain roles almost immediately and there have been no clashes about what needs to be done. Overall, our team worked together nicely, and we all made an equal contribution to the final product. </p>

    <h2>Meetings</h2>
    <p>MS Teams was the only tool that we used to communicate with each other.  We agreed to hold two meetings per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We conducted an interview in place of our group discussion on the 8th of Oct 2020 but followed up on the 9th of Oct with a group discussion as a replacement.</p>
